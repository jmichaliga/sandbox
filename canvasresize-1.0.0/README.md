canvasResize
=============

The plugin for client side image resizing. It's compatible with **iOS6** and **Android 2.3+**. 

It can work both with **jQuery** and **Zepto**

It is under the MIT License and It requires "binaryajax.js" and "exif.js" 
to work which is also under the MPL License [http://www.nihilogic.dk/licenses/mpl-license.txt]

I fixed iOS6 Safari's image file rendering issue for large size image (over mega-pixel) using few functions from 
[ios-imagefile-megapixel](https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel)
And fixed orientation issue by using 
[exif-js](https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js)
